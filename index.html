       <div class="one">
        <p>I would like to use this page to tell you a little bit about my background. I was born in Laguna Hills, California where I grew up. I attended college at Cal State University of Fullerton where I received a bachelor's degree in Business Administration with an emphasis in Marketing. My work background includes customer service, sales, administration, graphic design, and digital marketing related efforts.</p>

        <div class="two">
        <p>I moved to Portland, Oregon in January of 2018 in hopes to try something new, make a network of new friends and connections, and to continue to grow personally and proffessionally. I currently enjoy riding my bike for daily commuting and exploring the city.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="three">
        <p>Some of my interests include recording music at home, graphic design, movies, cooking, exercising, getting outdoors, DIY projects, trying new things, learning, video game emulators, synthesizer emulators, and all things computer related.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="four">
        <p>I have always had a passion for computers and technology. I have a strong personal connection to them because they remind me of some of fondest memories growing up. I have also always wanted to understand how to use computers better because it brings me great enjoyment and I would also like to be able to utilize them for more valuable skill sets. I decided to enroll at Epicodus to fully immerse myself in a new skill set and to make a career shift. I look forward to growing as a future developer and continuing to pursue various projects.</p>
